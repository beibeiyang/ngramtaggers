# n-gram Hidden Markov Model to identify gene names in biological text

Here's my solution to [Programming Assignment 1](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/nlangp/assignments/h1-p.3.pdf) of the
Coursera [Natural Language Processing course](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/notes-spring2013.html) by Michael Collins

Part I: Unigram tagger

Part II: Trigram tagger with my implementation of the Viterbi algorithm

Part III: Extended HMM tagger that groups words into four informative word classes (Numeric, All Capitals, Last Capital and Rare)
